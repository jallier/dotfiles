# dotfiles
dotfiles and a script to link them to the home folder

## How to use:
Clone the folder to somewhere convienient such as ~/dotfiles

```git clone https://github.com/jallier/dotfiles.git```

First check the script to make sure the file paths are correct, then run it. It will link the files in the git folder to the home folder in .file format
eg vimrc in the dotfiles folder becomes .vimrc in the ~ folder.


The script will then run Vundle and install the plugins. All done!
